# Full Stack Open - Modern Web Development Course

[Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I am a computer science student and have gained foundational knowledge through my studies. However, I feel that my understanding of modern web development technologies is insufficient. To address this, I decided to take this course, which covers contemporary technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, and RESTful APIs.

This repository contains the code for exercises I have completed.

The following is a summary from [https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info).

## Course Overview

This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.

Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and know the basics of the Git version control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.

### How much programming experience is needed?  
While this varies, participants should have a solid grasp of their programming language of choice. Typically, achieving this level of proficiency requires at least 100â€“200 hours of practice.

## Course Material

The course material is meant to be read one part at a time and in order.

The material contains exercises, which are placed so that the preceding material provides enough information for solving each exercise. You can do the exercises as you encounter them in the material, but it can also be beneficial to read all of the material in the part before starting with the exercises.

In many parts of the course, the exercises build one larger application one small piece at a time. Some of the exercise applications are developed through multiple parts.

The course material is based on incrementally expanding example applications, which change from part to part. It's best to follow the code along while making small modifications independently. The code of the example applications for each step of each part can be found on GitHub.
